So, I wanna build a system which will aggregate content from different platforms: blogs (using rss), reddit, youtube channels. For video content (youtube for example, not reddit), it will need to transcribe the content to get a transcription - from a real video, but youtube-provided. I will configure which reddits to check, which youtube channels, which blogs (rss urls). 



It should enable me to implement (separately, later) some AI tools to summarize the content, trace roots/sources (like find similar content and find who actually did it first), insights, summaries, newsletters, blog posts. Yet, during implementation of such systems I will need data already started to be collected. So I wanna start with 1st project - aggregator.  I wanna keep it simple ideally
